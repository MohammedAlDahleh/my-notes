 ## my-opinion
 I really interesting read this *How to Learn Things Fast Without Going Crazy* .
 The solution that I am about to propose is around one core idea: Learn the general idea fast, and then gradually deep dive in. From that perspective I built mysel.
 The goal is to build the must simple project that concludes the ideas learnt in step 1
 **Remember**: you can build the exact same project, but with different technology.
 For me it means **get to know the entire power of the technology beyond the basic use of it, and if possible, how does it work under the hood**.
